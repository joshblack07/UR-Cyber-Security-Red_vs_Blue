# UR-Cyber-Security-Red_vs_Blue
As the Red Team, you will attack a vulnerable VM within your environment, ultimately gaining root access to the machine. As Blue Team, you will use Kibana to review logs taken during their Day 1 engagement. You'll use the logs to extract hard data and visualizations for their report. Then, you will interpret your log data to suggest mitigation measures for each exploit that you've successfully performed.

## Part 2: Incident Analysis with Kibana

After creating your dashboard and becoming familiar with the search syntax, use these tools to answer the questions below:
Identify the offensive traffic.


Identify the traffic between your machine and the web machine:

When did the interaction occur?

  - 11/09/2021  16:00-19:00 PM

What responses did the victim send back?

  - HTTP Status Code 401: 15,981
  - HTTP Status Code 301: 2
  - HTTP Status Code 200: 952
  - HTTP Status Code 207: 12
  - HTTP Status Code 404: 6

What data is concerning from the Blue Team perspective?
  - 15,987 HTTP requests to http://192.168.1.105/company_folders/secrets_folder
  - 2 successful attempts (Code 301)
  - The data above is concerning because it shows repeated unsuccessful transaction attempts, and a spike in unique flow traffic, indicating a possible Brute Force attack.

Find the request for the hidden directory.


In your attack, you found a secret folder. Let's look at that interaction between these two machines.

How many requests were made to this directory? At what time and from which IP address(es)?

  - 15,987 HTTP requests to http://192.168.1.105/company_folders/secrets_folder
  - 11/09/2021  16:00-19:00 PM
  - Source IP: 192.168.1.1
  - 
Which files were requested? What information did they contain?

  - The file within the secrets-folder is connect_to_corp_server.  
  - This file has ryanâ€™s hashed password as well as other information.

What kind of alarm would you set to detect this behavior in the future?

  - Set an alarm if the folder is accessed

Identify at least one way to harden the vulnerable machine that would mitigate this attack.

  - This directory and file should be removed from the server all together.

Identify the brute force attack.


After identifying the hidden directory, you used Hydra to brute-force the target server. Answer the following questions:
Can you identify packets specifically from Hydra?

  - User_agent.original = Mozilla/4.0 (Hydra)

How many requests were made in the brute-force attack?

  - 15,987 HTTP requests

How many requests had the attacker made before discovering the correct password in this one?

  - 469

What kind of alarm would you set to detect this behavior in the future and at what threshold(s)?

  - Set an alarm based on the threshold for the number of HTTP requests

  - Set an alert when the user_agent.original includes Hydra

Identify at least one way to harden the vulnerable machine that would mitigate this attack.

  - After the limit of 10 401 Unauthorized codes have been returned from a server, that server can automatically drop traffic from the offending IP address for a period of 1 hour. 
  - We could also display a lockout message and lock the page from login for a temporary period of time from that user.

Find the WebDav connection.


Use your dashboard to answer the following questions:
How many requests were made to this directory?

  - 18

Which file(s) were requested?

  - The file that was within 192.168.1.105/webdav/ is shell.php

What kind of alarm would you set to detect such access in the future?
  - Set an alert anytime this directory is accessed by a machine other than the machine that should have access.

Identify at least one way to harden the vulnerable machine that would mitigate this attack.

  - Connections to this shared folder should not be accessible from the web interface.
  - Connections to this shared folder could be restricted by machine with a firewall rule.

Identify the reverse shell and meterpreter traffic.


To finish off the attack, you uploaded a PHP reverse shell and started a meterpreter shell session. Answer the following questions:
Can you identify traffic from the meterpreter session?

  - source.ip: 192.168.1.105 and destination.port: 4444

What kinds of alarms would you set to detect this behavior in the future?

  - We can set an alert for any traffic moving over port 4444.
  - We can set an alert for any .php file that is uploaded to a server.

Identify at least one way to harden the vulnerable machine that would mitigate this attack.
  - Removing the ability to upload files to this directory over the web interface would take care of this issue.

## Part Three: Reporting
