# UR-Cyber-Security-Red_vs_Blue
As the Red Team, you will attack a vulnerable VM within your environment, ultimately gaining root access to the machine. As Blue Team, you will use Kibana to review logs taken during their Day 1 engagement. You'll use the logs to extract hard data and visualizations for their report. Then, you will interpret your log data to suggest mitigation measures for each exploit that you've successfully performed.
