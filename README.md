# University of Richmond Cybersecurity Capstone #2

  - As the Red Team, I attacked a vulnerable VM, ultimately gaining root access to the machine. 
  - As the Blue Team, I used Kibana to review logs taken during the Red Team Engagement. 
  - I used the logs to extract hard data and visualizations for the report. 
  - Then, I will interpreted log data to suggest mitigation measures for each exploit.

**Here** is a PowerPoint Presentation of the Capstone.

# Network Topology

The following machines live on the network:

| **Name**     | **IP Address** |
|----------|------------|
| Kali    |  192.168.1.90  |
| Target    | 192.168.1.105   |
|ELK | 192.168.1.100   |

# Red Team
## What were the three most critical vulnerabilities discovered?

While the web server suffers from several vulnerabilities, the three below are the most critical:

  - **Sensitive Data Exposure**: Exposure of the secret_folder directory and the connect_to_corp_server file compromised the credentials of the Web DAV folder. Sensitive Data Exposure (SDE) is an OWASP Top 10 vulnerability.

  - **Unauthorized File Upload**: The web server allows users to upload arbitrary files â€” specifically, PHP scripts. This exposes the machine to the wide array of attacks enabled by malicious files.

  - **Remote Code Execution**: As a consequence of the unauthorized file upload vulnerability, attackers can upload web shells and achieve arbitrary remote code execution on the web server.

Additional severe vulnerabilities include:

  - Lack of mitigation against brute force attacks
  - No authentication for sensitive data, e.g., secret_folder
  - Plaintext protocols (HTTP and WebDAV)

# Blue Team
## What evidence did you find in the logs of the attack? What data should you be monitoring to detect these attacks in the future?

A considerable amount of data is available in the logs. Specifically, evidence of the following was obtained upon inspection:

  - Traffic from attack VM to target, including unusually high volume of requests
  - Access to sensitive data in the secret_folder directory
  - Brute-force attack against the HTTP server
  - POST request corresponding to upload of shell.php

**Unusual Request Volume**: Logs indicate an unusual number of requests and failed responses between the Kali VM and the target. Note that 401, 301, 200, 207, and 404 are the top responses.

| HTTP Status Code | Count |
|----------|------------|
|   401    |   15,981   |
|   301    |     2      |
|   200    |    952     |
|   207    |     12     |
|   404    |     6      |

In addition, note the connection spike in the Connections over time [Packetbeat Flows] ECS, as well as the spike in errors in the Errors vs successful transactions [Packetbet] ECS

**SCREENSHOT**

**Access to Sensitive Data in secret_folder**: On the dashboard you built, a look at your Top 10 HTTP requests [Packetbeat] ECS panel. In this example, this folder was requested 15,987 times. The file connect_to_corp_server was requested 3 times.

**SCREENSHOT**

**HTTP Brute Force Attack**: Searching for url.path: /company_folders/secret_folder/ shows conversations involving the sensitive data. Specifically, the results contain requests from the brute-forcing tool Hydra, identified under the user_agent.original section:

**SCREENSHOT**

In addition, the logs contain evidence of a large number of requests for the sensitive data, of which only 3 were successful. This is a telltale signature of a brute-force attack. 

  - 15,987 HTTP requests to http://192.168.1.105/company_folders/secrets_folder
  - 2 successful attempts (Code 301)
  - 11/09/2021  16:00-19:00 PM
  - Source IP: 192.168.1.1

WebDAV Connection & Upload of shell.php: The logs also indicate that an unauthorized actor was able to access protected data in the webdav directory. The passwd.dav file was requested via GET, and shell.php uploaded via POST.

**Mitigation**: What alarms should you set to detect this behavior next time? What controls should you put in place on the target to prevent the attack from happening?

**Solution**: Mitigation steps for each vulnerability above are provided below.

  * High Volume of Traffic from Single Endpoint

    * Rate-limiting traffic from a specific IP address would reduce the web server's susceptibility to DoS conditions, as well as provide a hook against which to trigger alerts against suspiciously suspiciously fast series of requests that may be indicative of scanning.

  * Access to sensitive data in the secret_folder directory

    * First, the secret_folder directory should be protected with stronger authentication. E.g., it could be moved to a server to which only key-based SSH access from whitelisted IPs is enabled.
    * Second, the data inside of secret_folder should be encrypted at rest.
    * Third, Filebeat should be configured to monitor access to the secret_folder directory and its contents.
    * Fourth, access to secret_folder should be whitelisted, and access from IPs not on this whitelist, logged.

  * Brute-force attack against the HTTP server

    * The fail2ban utility can be enabled to protect against brute force attacks.

  * POST request corresponding to upload of **shell.php**

    * File uploads should require authentication.
    * In addition, the server should implement an upload filter and forbid users from uploading files that may contain executable code.
